Collect BindCraft2 campaign results into the (child) binder table.

``run_bindcraft2.py`` points each campaign's ``project_folder`` at
``<out_dir>/campaigns/<name>/``, where BindCraft2 writes three stage folders, each
with a table this collector can read:

    campaigns/<name>/1_Trajectories/!_Trajectories.csv        one row per attempt
    campaigns/<name>/1_Trajectories/<design>/<design>_trajectory.cif
    campaigns/<name>/2_Refolded/!_Refolded.csv       every scored candidate + outcome
    campaigns/<name>/2_Refolded/Complexes/<design>.cif
    campaigns/<name>/3_Ranked/!_Ranked.csv          the accepted designs, best-first
    campaigns/<name>/3_Ranked/<design>.cif

Which one to read is **decided by the run, not guessed here**: a `--trajectory-only`
run fills `1_Trajectories` and never accepts anything, so `3_Ranked` stays empty. The
run records that in the out_dir sidecar and `--stage auto` (the default) follows it,
the same contract that keeps `input_column` consistent between the two phases. Pass
`--stage` explicitly only to override.

* ``trajectories`` -- the hallucinated **backbones**, before any sequence redesign.
  The rows to hand to `atomium` / `proteinmpnn`. Note their `sequence` is the one the
  gradient happened to land on, which is exactly what you are about to replace.
* ``refolded`` -- every candidate the campaign scored, rejects included, with
  ``outcome`` and ``failed_filters``. What to read when a campaign accepted nothing.
* ``ranked`` -- only what the campaign accepted.

A trajectory row's ``terminated`` column names the stage the attempt stopped at;
blank means it ran to completion. They are collected rather than dropped, so filter
on it (``-f``) instead of assuming every row is a usable backbone.

Rows are keyed by BindCraft2's own ``design`` identity rather than by position:
``!_Ranked.csv`` is re-sorted by ``i_pDAE`` after every acceptance, so an index into
it is not stable across a re-collect, while the design name (campaign, modality,
length and recipe hash) is. The submitter sets ``campaign_name`` to the parent row's
name, so a design name already starts with its parent; the prefix is only added here
when a --set override has changed that.

Each accepted complex is converted to PDB (downstream tools consume PDB) and becomes
the row's ``<leaf>_path``; the source mmCIF stays available as ``<leaf>_cif_path``.
Note the structure is the **complex**, binder + target, not the binder alone.

Multi-target campaigns (``sapia run bindcraft2 --targets ...``)
--------------------------------------------------------------
A design is still **one row** -- one binder sequence is one entity, however many
targets it was optimised against. What changes is that every reading becomes several.
Two upstream behaviours, both silently mis-read by a single-target collector:

* **File fan-out.** With two or more prepared states the written filename gains a
  ``_<target name>`` suffix (``campaign_output.accepted_state_suffixes``), and that
  suffix is *empty* for a single target -- so the filename shape changes the moment a
  second target appears. One design writes one complex per target. File order is
  alphabetical while the CSV's target order is by descending weight, so "the first
  file" and "the first value in a cell" are not the same target.
* **Semicolon cells.** ``campaign_output.target_ordered_row`` collapses every
  per-target reading into one ``;``-joined string (``0.82;0.79;0.31``), ordered by
  descending weight then name, with **empty positions kept** for missing readings, and
  adds the row's own key: ``targets`` and ``target_weights``.

So this collector splits each ``;`` cell into one column per target, keyed on the
row's own ``targets`` cell -- never on position, never on alphabetical order:

    bindcraft2_i_pTM_hEGFR        an ON-target reading
    bindcraft2_i_pTM_off_hERBB2   an OFF-target (detarget) reading
    bindcraft2_path_hEGFR         that target's complex
    bindcraft2_path               the HIGHEST-WEIGHT on-target complex

An off-target's columns carry an ``off_`` infix because upstream deliberately excludes
detargets from its own ranking (``on_target_mean``), and averaging or comparing a
detarget reading against a binding reading inverts its meaning. ``run_bindcraft2.py``
refuses a target actually named ``off_*`` so the infix stays unambiguous.

**Error contracts.** A cell whose ``;`` value count disagrees with the number of names
in ``targets`` makes that design an ``error`` status -- never a best-effort parse. A
missing per-target complex is ``NA``, never a substituted sibling file. An empty
position in a ``;`` cell is ``NA``, never ``0``.

Safe to re-run: rows are rebuilt from the CSV and the structures on disk.
